# Wardrobe Item Service Refactoring

## Overview

The `itemService.ts` file was refactored into multiple focused service modules to improve maintainability, readability, and separation of concerns. The original file (435 lines) was split into five specialized modules while maintaining backward compatibility for existing code.

## Modular Structure

### Base Module: `itemBaseService.ts`
- Common utilities and constants
- Error handling functions
- Data conversion helpers (snake_case/camelCase)
- Shared database table constants

### CRUD Module: `itemCrudService.ts`
- Core Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Item activation/deactivation functions
- Deprecated API-compatible functions with localStorage fallbacks

### Query Module: `itemQueryService.ts`
- Specialized query functions
- Category-based filtering
- Expired image URL detection
- Items without hashtags queries
- Item retrieval by IDs

### Image Module: `itemImageService.ts`
- Image URL generation and handling
- Signed URL generation with proper logging

### Migration Module: `itemMigrationService.ts`
- LocalStorage to Supabase migration utilities
- Batch processing for migration

## Backward Compatibility

The `index.ts` file has been updated to import from all new modules and re-export the functions with the same names and signatures as before. This ensures that existing code using these services will continue to work without changes.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Better Code Organization**: Related functions are grouped together
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common utilities extracted to base service
4. **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Each module's dependencies are explicitly imported
6. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across modules
7. **Better Type Safety**: Consistent typing across all modules

## Future Improvements

1. Gradually update imports across the codebase to use the specific services directly
2. Add more comprehensive unit tests for each module
3. Phase out deprecated functions once all legacy code is updated
4. Add validation functions to prevent invalid data

## Migration Notes

No database changes were required for this refactoring as it only affected the code organization, not the data structure.
